Projet with the ring http library in clojure. The idea was to use Google Picasa's upload image functionality to export tags and pictures to a database. The goal was to track my pictures better (see http://xkcd.com/512/) because the situation is getting a bit unwieldy.

Development stopped after proof of concept was less than convincing and Picasa was a bit of a disappointment in terms of tagging pictures and managing them.
